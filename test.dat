Subject: Re: a MIME-Version misfeature

This message has been composed in the 'multipart' format for extended
mail bodies.  If you are reading this prefix, your mail reader probably has
not yet been modified to understand the new format, and some of what follows
may look strange.  You may wish to look into upgrading your mail reader.

I have no problem with changing the BNF to permit the period, as Mark
suggests.   However, I disagree violently with the following comment:

By the way, this message is being sent by an experimental version of
Andrew I'm playing with.  I'd be interested in any comments you have on
its formatting, etc.  -- Nathaniel
